WHAT?  ANOTHER BETA TEST VERSION FOR TINYHAWK S?  YASSSS!!

After hearing great things about 48khz on JESC, I decided to give RPM filtering another shot, and I think this MIGHT be the best thing for 2s on the TinyHawk S.  Motor temps aren't even warm (but it is winter in Portland so please check your TEMPS!!) and I'm getting 30 seconds longer flights RIPPING on 2s.

YOU MUST flash JESC 48khz to make this work the best!

PID Profile 1 is 1s and can be used on the original TinyHawk and the TinyHawk S.
PID Profile 2 is 2s for the TinyHawk S only
PID Profile 3 is whatever EMAX had as PID Profile 3 
CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS RELEASES!
AIRMODE is on, even for Angle mode. The benefits of Absolute Control were outweighing the benefits of having Airmode off, but feel free to turn it off if you want (I have it on a switch).
FPV Angle Mix is on for all modes, change it to your liking.
Camera Angle matches the 20 degree camera angle of the stock Hawk. Older versions of PMB had this at 12 degrees, so if you want to get that feel, go to the Config tab and change it back.
Please check motor temps on 2s. It's winter in Portland, so motor temps weren't an issue, but those in warmer climates should test.
BOTH TinyHawks were stock other than the original was switched to quad blade props. Brand new RDQ 450 1s HV batteries were used in both and RaceDayQuads 300 2s batteries were used for the S in 2s.
